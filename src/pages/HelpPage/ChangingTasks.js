      <h2>Why Change Task Status?</h2>
      <p>
        Changing the status of tasks between "Open" and "Completed" is an
        essential feature in task management systems. It allows users to track
        the progress of their tasks and ensures efficient workflow management.
        Here are a few reasons why changing task status is important:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tracking Progress:</strong> By changing the status of a task
          from "Open" to "Completed," users can easily keep track of the tasks
          they have finished. This provides a clear overview of the progress
          made and helps in prioritizing remaining tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Workflow Management:</strong> Task status changes help in
          managing the workflow effectively. When a task is marked as
          "Completed," it indicates that the task has been finished and can be
          removed from the active task list. This ensures that users focus on
          the tasks that are still in progress.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaboration:</strong> In collaborative environments,
          changing task status allows team members to communicate the progress
          of their work. It helps team members understand which tasks are
          completed and which ones are still pending, facilitating better
          coordination and collaboration.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reporting and Analysis:</strong> Task status changes provide
          valuable data for reporting and analysis purposes. By analyzing the
          time taken to complete tasks and the distribution of completed tasks
          over time, organizations can identify bottlenecks, optimize processes,
          and improve overall productivity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In conclusion, changing the status of tasks between "Open" and
        "Completed" is crucial for effective task management, workflow
        optimization, collaboration, and data analysis. It empowers individuals
        and teams to stay organized, track progress, and drive positive change
        in their work.
