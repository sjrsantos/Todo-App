      <h2>Why Remove Tasks?</h2>
      <p>
        Removing tasks from our task list is an essential practice in task
        management. Here are a few reasons why it is important to keep removing
        tasks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Organizational Efficiency:</strong> By removing completed or
          irrelevant tasks, we can maintain a clean and organized task list.
          This helps us focus on the tasks that are still pending or require
          immediate attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear Prioritization:</strong> Regularly removing tasks allows
          us to reassess and reprioritize our workload. We can identify tasks
          that are no longer relevant or less important and allocate our time
          and resources to more critical tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improved Productivity:</strong> A cluttered task list can be
          overwhelming and hinder productivity. By removing completed tasks, we
          can reduce visual noise and create a clear visual representation of
          our remaining workload. This helps us stay focused and motivated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Accurate Progress Tracking:</strong> Removing tasks helps us
          accurately track our progress. It allows us to measure our
          accomplishments and see how far we have come in completing our tasks
          and achieving our goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Effective Collaboration:</strong> When working in a team,
          removing tasks ensures that everyone is on the same page. It helps
          team members understand which tasks are completed and which ones are
          still pending, facilitating effective communication and collaboration.
        </li>
      </ul>
